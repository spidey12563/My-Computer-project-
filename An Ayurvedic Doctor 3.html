I want to become an Ayurvedic Doctor for the following reasons:<br>
</h3>
<h4>
<ul>
<li>Ayurveda encourages lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to regain balance between the body, mind, spirit, and environment i.e. changes the lifestyle of people.
<li>I want to teach about longevity, keeping the body, mind, and the world in perfect harmony.
<li>Ayurveda provides the tools we need to understand what is health and what can we do to support it. I want every one of us to take back our power and claim our ability to manifest a healthy life.
<li>Ayurveda is a broad road map to sustainable living, self-empowered health building, total personalization of health, and self-love for a unique mind and body.
</ul>

<h4>
<ul>
<li>Ayurvedic medicines are safe and less expensive, provide long-lasting relief, and cure the root cause so I want the patients to safeguard their life against the chemical effect of allopathic expensive medicines that can protect their body organs.
<li>Ayurvedic medicines work on the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of a person with a holistic approach.
<li>Ayurvedic treatment is based on treating patients naturally instead of purely medicinally.
<li>Allopathic medicines have many side effects and do not remove the root cause of the disease. Some of the side effects are constipation, which causes many diseases, skin rashes, diarrhea, drowsiness, insomnia, and effect on the kidney, liver, gall bladder, etc
<li>Ayurvea examines the body and takes account of all the aspects of one life and into account which helps to identify the cause of any disorder this helps to cure the disease from the root and prevents reoccurrence of the same.
</ul>
